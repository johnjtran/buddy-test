## Buddy Test

> An example of using Buddy for auth with Clojure, accompanying [this blog post](https://adambard.com/blog/buddy-password-auth-example/).

This is a fork of Adam Bard's most excellent tutorial on integrating buddy with your web application.  The main difference here is we've integrated leinigen with his example.

Note that this is rather barebone `compojure` integration.  So it's light and can easily be integrated into another compojure-flavored ring application flow.

### TODO

- [ ] Add tutorial on multiple users
- [ ] Add tutorial on rest/api
